2. Define a class named `Person` in the `Person.java` file with the following structure:

   -  first_name (String)
   -  last_name (String)
   -  age (int)
   -  height (double) - in meters

-  Create the following methods within the class:
   -  `fullName`: Returns the full name of the person (first name and last name separated by a space).
   -  `changeAge`: Modifies the age value of the person to inputted value. The method should return the updated mileage.
   -  `ageInDecade`: Returns the person's age in 10 years.

3. Create a separate file named `Assignment.java` within the same folder as `Person.java`. Import the Person class into this file.

4. In your `Assignment.java` file:

-  Use the Person class to:
   -  Instantiate an object with sample values.
   -  Print the full name of your person object using the `fullName` method.
